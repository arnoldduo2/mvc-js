# Demo Content - Safe to Delete

This folder contains demo pages, examples, and documentation content for showcasing the MVC-JS framework.

## What's Inside

- **Demo Pages** - Example pages showing framework features
- **Code Examples** - Sample code snippets and implementations
- **Documentation Assets** - Images, diagrams, and other demo resources

## When Building Your App

**You can safely delete this entire `demo/` folder** when you're ready to build your application. It won't affect the core framework functionality.

### What to Keep

The core framework files you need are:

- `src/App/Core/` - Core framework classes
- `src/Helpers/` - Helper functions
- `src/config/` - Configuration files
- `src/boot/` - Bootstrap files
- `src/routes/` - Your route definitions
- `.htaccess` - URL rewriting
- `index.php` - Entry point
- `composer.json` - Dependencies

### What to Delete

When starting your project:

1. Delete `src/resources/views/pages/home.php` (demo home page)
2. Delete `src/resources/views/pages/about.php` (demo about page)
3. Delete `src/resources/views/pages/dashboard.php` (demo dashboard)
4. Delete `demo/` folder (this folder)
5. Update routes in `src/routes/web.php`
6. Create your own controllers and views
